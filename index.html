    <p>Extra Javascript Practice
        I get a lot of questions about how you can practice and learn more Javascript (the core concept that you really want to master if you want to be a Developer). Anyway, I wanted to share with you the 3 free resources that I recommend. In my opinion they offer incredible insight into Javascript and are better than most paid options out there. They will really solidify your knowledge if you do them along with the course, in your spare time, or throughout your career:
        
        1. https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS
        
        2. http://javascript.info/
        
        3. http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/javascript-the-core-2nd-edition/
        
        or... you can avoid all of that and just check out my Advanced JavaScript Full Course.
